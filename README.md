This is a Flight Reservation System which has been provided with 2 classes namely Aircraft and Flight and hardcoded values of the passengers and the aircrafts are given.
This system uses all the basic fundamentals of Python and can be considered as a good starter project for Python.
I have attached a prograrm flow argument doc along with this if you are stuck with it.

Soon, I will upload a Desktop or a Web application for the same.
Good luck!
